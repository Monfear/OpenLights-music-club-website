                Open Lights Club scale meets Bushwick style in this sprawling entertainment complex tucked away in a
                burgeoning nightlife district off the Jefferson Avenue strip. The big room fits 700 peeps and boasts a
                sensory-overloading laser-and-LED light show. And the talent’s decidedly left of the dial, featuring
                indie-rockers and DJs with a foot still in the underground as well as all-nighters, such as the queer
                Latinx
                party Papi Juice. Elsewhere also features a smaller side room that offers its own programming, a second
                space for larger shindigs and a quiet cocktail lounge upstairs, plus a spacious rooftop deck.
                Brooklyn’s DIY scene gets a neon-lit glow up at this sprawling music venue off Jefferson Avenue. This
                summer, it's reopened with reduced capacity on the roof: there will be 15 tables set up, with seating
                for
                two, four and six. Drink hits like the frozen spicy mango Margaritas and Red Bull coconut rum are back
                on
                the menu as well as food from Holyground BBQ. The venue's also hosting “Sunstreams,” a concert series to
                raise funds for racial justice community resource organizations.
